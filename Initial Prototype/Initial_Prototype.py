                    Someone graduated at the age of 22,
                    but waited 5 years before securing a good job!
                    Someone became a CEO at 25,
                    and died at 50.
                    While another became a CEO at 50,
                    and lived to 90 years.
                    Someone is still single,
                    while someone else got married.
                    Obama retires at 55,
                    but Trump starts at 70.
                    Charles Njonjo married at 52 and is now 96...his peers could have married at 25 and died at 50.
                    Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their Time Zone.
                    People around you might seem to go ahead of you,
                    some might seem to be behind you.
                    But everyone is running their own RACE, in their own TIME.
                    Don't envy them or mock them.
                    They are in their TIME ZONE, and you are in yours!
                    Life is about waiting for the right moment to act.
                    So, RELAX.
                    You are not LATE.
                    You are not EARLY.
                    You are very much ON TIME, and in your TIME ZONE Destiny set up for you.
